# Contractor Website

This is a website that will be built as a model for a music contracting service in which users may submit forms requesting specific types of groups, musical requests, gig info and 
any other relevant information. This site will also contain information about some of the potential contracted musicians that may be hired as well as an overview of 
services.

This project is being built to fulfill the requirements of Code Louisville's JavaScript course and will implement the following features:

## To start node server
`'npm start'`
or
`'node index.js'`

### Complete: 
- Create a web server with at least one route and connect to it from your application using ExpressJS
- Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file (implemented with sqlite3)
- Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application

### WIP
- Quote creation: Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value

### Proposed:

- Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
- Create 3 or more unit tests for your application (and document how to run them)
